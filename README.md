# Contributing

If you have tested some games in Pluvia and would like to add your findings, please make a pull request with your findings. If the device you tested on does not exist in the repo, make sure to add a folder for it including a folder for the manufacturer if it does not already exist, and place a README.md file inside. The AYN Odin 2 Mini file can be used as reference to how to format the list. Below are the different status types that can be put in the `Status` column of the compatibility list.
